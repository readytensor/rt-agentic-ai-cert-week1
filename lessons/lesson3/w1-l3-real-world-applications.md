### System Overview

At the centre of it all is the **Orchestrator Agent**, which is the brain that receives your prompt, decides what needs to be done, delegates tasks to specialized agents, and compiles the final answer.

### **Scenario 1: "Do I have any emails from Abhy?"**

1.  You give your prompt to the assistant.
2.  The **Orchestrator Agent** interprets the intent ‚Äî it detects that this is a Gmail-related task.
3.  It delegates the task to the **Gmail Agent**, which connects to your Gmail account.
4.  The **Gmail Agent** searches your inbox for messages from ‚ÄúAbhy‚Äù.
5.  It returns the relevant results back to the **Orchestrator Agent**.
6.  The **Orchestrator Agent** compiles and delivers the final answer.

### **Scenario 2: "What's trending in NYT news today?"**

1.  The **Orchestrator Agent** receives your question.
2.  It determines that a web search is needed and forwards the request to the **Web Search Agent**.
3.  The **Web Search Agent** queries trusted sources, gathers articles, and identifies key trends.
4.  It sends a summarized version of the top news trends to the **Orchestrator Agent**.
5.  The **Orchestrator Agent** packages this into a clean final answer for you.

### **Scenario 3: "What did my team say in Slack about the demo?"**

1.  Your prompt is routed to the **Orchestrator Agent**.
2.  It identifies that the query pertains to Slack messages and invokes the **Slack Agent**.
3.  The **Slack Agent** connects to your Slack workspace and filters relevant messages mentioning the demo.
4.  It returns a set of Slack messages or summaries to the **Orchestrator Agent**.
5.  You receive the final, context-aware answer based on recent team discussions.

### What Makes This an Agentic System?

Unlike simple chatbots that wait for specific instructions, this system is powered by **AI agents** that:

- **Interpret** your prompt intelligently,
- **Decide** which tool or agent to activate,
- **Execute** complex tasks autonomously, and
- **Deliver** a coherent final result through reasoning, delegation, and synthesis.
