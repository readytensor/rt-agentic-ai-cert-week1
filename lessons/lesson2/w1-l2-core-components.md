# The Core Components of AI Agents

We are going to categorise these components into two major categories.

**1. Architectural Components**

**2. Cognitive Components**

## Architectural Components

These are the foundational building blocks in every AI agent‚Äôs design (Every agentic system must have these building blocks). They include:

**1. Large Language Models (LLMS): The Brain**
LLMS function as the central processing unit of AI agents, similar to the human brain. They're responsible for:

- Understanding user input
- Deciding which tools to use
- Generating final answers after processing information

**2. Tools Integration: The "Hands"**
Tools allow AI agents to interact with the digital world, such as:

- APIS for accessing external services
- Web crawlers for searching information
- Database connectors for retrieving stored data

**3. Memory Systems: The "Recall"**
Memory enables agents to retain and reuse information across interactions, creating personalised context. Without memory, an agent would be like a goldfish, forgetting every conversation instantly.

AI agents can have different types of memory:
**Short-term Memory:** This type of memory tracks the ongoing conversation, maintaining coherence within a single interaction.
**Long-term Memory:** This memory stores information across multiple interactions, allowing the AI to remember user preferences, past queries, and more.

So in a nutshell, every agent must have an LLM that helps it think and make decisions on what to do, a tool(s) that it interacts with to perform specific tasks and a memory (database) where it stores necessary information.--DIVIDER--## Cognitive Components

These define how agents "think" and act:

**1. Perception: The "Senses"**
This is the AI agent's ability to gather and interpret data from its surroundings, like human senses, perception allows the agent to "see" and "hear" the world around it through interfaces with APIS, databases, or web services.

**2. Reasoning: The "Logic"**
Once data is gathered, reasoning allows the agent to make sense of it by analysing information, identifying patterns, and drawing conclusions. This transforms raw data into actionable insights.

**3. Action: The "Doing"**
This represents the agent's ability to bring decisions to life, whether physical (like a robot moving an object) or digital (such as sending an email). This capability to take action based on perception and reasoning is what makes an AI agent autonomous.

**4. Feedback & Learning: The "Growth"**
Perhaps the most fascinating aspect of AI agents is their ability to learn and improve over time. Learning allows agents to adapt to new situations, refine decision-making processes, and become more efficient.--DIVIDER--## Agent Autonomy: The Ability to Choose

It is also important to note that what truly makes an AI system an "agent" is its autonomy. It's ability to:

- Evaluate multiple possible actions
- Make independent decisions about which action to take
- Execute those actions without direct human intervention

Some agents may require human approval (Human In the Loop) for certain actions, while others operate with greater independence. This decision-making capability is what transforms a passive model or tool into an active agent that can pursue goals and complete tasks.

The degree of autonomy we grant AI agents involves important considerations about:

- The complexity of decisions they can make
- The scope of actions available to them
- The oversight mechanisms in place
